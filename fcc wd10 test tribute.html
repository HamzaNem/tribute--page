                <li>This man was a gift from God where he deposited intelligence, courage, honesty, purity and patriotism.</li>
                <li>The photograph of his arrest was published one day in all the newspapers in Algiers. The photograph showed Larbi Ben M'hidi with handcuffs on his wrists and ankles, with a cheerful brave face.</li>
                <li>He was captured by French paratroopers in February 1957. His death was announced in March 1957 by Pierre Gorlin, Robert Lacoste’s press officer. The events surrounding his death were disputed, and contended by many that he was in fact tortured before being summarily executed. Many who knew him, have ruled out the possibility of him taking his own life, as was reported in the media, due to his devotion to Islam, which forbids suicide. In 2000, General Aussaresses admitted that Ben M’hidi was executed whilst in his custody, however, the exact truth regarding his death remains a mystery to this day.</li>
